A dynamic algorithm is designed that directs the robot to navigate smoothly in any flat environments, avoiding obstacles. The obstacle detection scheme is based on an ultrasonic sensor. The microcontroller takes input from the sensor and then compares the input with predefined reference. Then it gives input to the two h-bridges that in turn direct the motors to control the movement of the robo-car. Here, the car moves continuously forward and avoid obstacles by stopping and steering away immediately.","tags":[],"title":"DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN OBSTACLE AVOIDING ROBO-CAR","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.A Sohaly"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569734127,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569734127,"objectID":"114cf35b64ef6cc07b919e7c86a0bb13","permalink":"https://farzana-akter.github.io/publication/electrical-character/","publishdate":"2019-09-29T11:15:27+06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/electrical-character/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Structural and Electrical Characterization of Sn doped ZnSThin Films Synthesized by Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.A.

An analysis derived from XRD pattern revealed the presence of cubic structure in the Sn:ZnS thin films, with an impurity phase corresponding to the insertion of Sn ions in interstitial sites or defects of the lattice. The atomic ratio of Sn in ZnS films have been confirmed by EDX spectra. Changes in the optical properties of the films have been observed due to incorporation of Sn by UV-Vis-Nir Spectrophotometer analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Structural and Optical Properties of Sn doped ZnS Thin Films Synthesized by Chemical Bath Deposition Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Detail optical and structural characterizations have been done by UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction analysis to get a comparative study between 3 samples. The XRD analysis has revealed that CdS and ZnO have hexagonal wurtzite crystal structures while ZnS has Zinc blend crystal structure. Lattice parameter and crystallite size were also measured from XRD. From UV spectra it is seen that ZnS and ZnO have transmittance in the range of (85-90) % which was greater than that of CdS. Deposited CdS, ZnS and ZnO reportedly have band gaps of 2.0 eV, 3.63 eV and 3.65 eV respectively. It is proposed that among 3 samples ZnO has more suitable properties as the window layer for thin film solar cell.","tags":[],"title":"Investigation of Structural and Optical Properties of CdS, ZnO, ZnS Thin Film for Heterojunction Solar Cell","type":"publication"}]
